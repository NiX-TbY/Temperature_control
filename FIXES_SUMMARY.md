# Temperature Control - Compilation Fixes Summary

## Original Problems
The compilation errors were all related to "declared in this scope" issues:

### 1. Missing Class Declaration
- **Error**: `'TemperatureController' does not name a type`
- **Fix**: Created `include/controllers/temperature_controller.h` with complete class declaration

### 2. Missing Member Variables  
- **Error**: `'_state' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'_config' was not declared in this scope`
- **Fix**: Added all member variables to TemperatureController class

### 3. Missing Method Declarations
- **Error**: `'activateHeating' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'activateCooling' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'activateFan' was not declared in this scope`
- **Fix**: Added all method declarations to header file and implementations to source

### 4. Missing Type Definitions
- **Error**: `'SensorData' does not name a type`
- **Error**: `'SystemMode' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'STATUS_IDLE' was not declared in this scope`
- **Fix**: Created `include/types/types.h` with all required types and enums

### 5. Missing Arduino Headers and Constants
- **Error**: `'millis' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'digitalWrite' was not declared in this scope`
- **Error**: `'HIGH' was not declared in this scope`
- **Fix**: Added proper `#include <Arduino.h>` and created `include/config/config.h`

### 6. Missing Constants
- **Error**: Pin definitions and temperature limits not found
- **Fix**: Added all required constants in config.h

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Complete Class Definition**: All methods and member variables properly declared
2. **Proper Include Structure**: Hierarchical includes prevent circular dependencies  
3. **Type Safety**: All custom types defined before use
4. **Arduino Compatibility**: Proper Arduino framework integration
5. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into logical components

## Verification

All files now compile successfully with no "declared in this scope" errors.
The project structure follows PlatformIO conventions and Arduino framework requirements.
