## 5. Sensor Design..............................................................................................................................................

## 5.1 Layout of Rx Channels........................................................................................................................

SENS0 to SENS13 are 14 Rx channels on the chip directly connected to 14 ITO Rx channels on the
sensor either in sequence or reverse sequence. Please refer to the tool _GT9 Series Channel
Selector_ for channel selection when there are less ITO Rx channels on the sensor than Rx channels
on the chip.

Sample Layout: the ITO Rx channels on the sensor are connected to the Rx channels on the chip in
sequence from SENS0 to SENS13:

## 5.2 Layout of Tx Channels........................................................................................................................

DRV0 to DRV25 are 26 Tx channels on the chip directly connected to 26 ITO Tx channels on the
sensor. Please refer to the tool _GT9SeriesChannelSelector_ for channel selection and assignment.

After the layout of the Tx channels is determined, relevant registers of GT911 shall be configured to
ensure logic positions of Tx channels are consistent with their physical positions, so that the reported
coordinates match the physical coordinates.

For details of sensor design, please refer to layout guidelines.

## 5.3 Sensor Design Specifications............................................................................................................

Note:

```
1) For detailed sensor design specifications, please refer to Sensor Design Guidelines of
Goodix.
2) When metal traces are employed for routing, some traces may be oxidized due to process
control or other reasons and their impedance will become larger, making the impedance
vary between traces. When ITO are employed for routing, though we’ve done our utmost to
obtain impedance consistency by using matched length and width in design, there are still
differences. To ensure data consistency and uniformity on the entire screen, it is necessary
to ensure the sensor design complies with the above requirements.
3) In addition, when Tx trace and Rx trace are adjacent and parallel to each other, separate the
traces with a ground trace. For ground trace width, please refer to SensorDesignGuidelines.
Note that ground trace width should not be less than 0.2mm.
```
## 5.4 Touch Key Design................................................................................................................................

GT911 supports at most 4 separated touch keys in the following two ways:

1) _Rxchannelextension_ : Take one Tx channel as a common port for the touch keys and connect
the Tx channel to four Rx channels to enable four touch keys. The touch
keys must not share their Tx channel with the touch screen. However, Rx
channels have to be shared.

_2) Touch key design on FPC:_ Connect one separate Tx channel to four Rx channels to enable
four touch keys. The touch keys have to share their Rx channels with the
touch screen.

```
Touch key pattern on FPC should be designed independently.
```

## 6. I^2 C Communication......................................................................................................................................

### 6.1 I^2 C Timing..........................................................................................................................................

```
GT911 provides a standard I^2 C interface for SCL and SDA to communicate with the host. GT
always serves as slave device in the system with all communication being initialized by the host.
It is strongly recommended that transmission rate be kept at or below 400Kbps. The I^2 C timing is
shown below:
```
**Test condition 1: 1.8V host interface voltage, 400Kbps transmission rate, 2K pull-up resistor**

```
Parameter Symbol Min. Max. Unit
SCL low period tlo 1.3 - us
SCL high period thi 0.6 - us
SCL setup time for Start condition tst1 0.6 - us
SCL setup time for Stop condition tst3 0.6 - us
SCL hold time for Start condition thd1 0.6 - us
SDA setup time tst2 0.1 - us
SDA hold time thd2 0 - us
```
**Test condition 2: 3.3V host interface voltage, 400Kbps transmission rate, 2K pull-up resistor**

```
Parameter Symbol Min. Max. Unit
SCL low period tlo 1.3 - us
SCL high period thi 0.6 - us
SCL setup time for Start condition tst1 0.6 - us
SCL setup time for Stop condition tst3 0.6 - us
SCL hold time for Start condition thd1 0.6 - us
SDA setup time tst2 0.1 - us
SDA hold time thd2 0 - us
```
GT911 supports two I^2 C slave addresses: 0xBA/0xBB and 0x28/0x29. The host can select the
address by changing the status of Reset and INT pins during the power-on initialization phase. See
the diagram below for configuration methods and timings:

```
#### a) Data Transmission.....................................................................................................................

(For example：device address is 0xBA/0xBB)

Communication is always initiated by the host. Valid Start condition is signaled by pulling SDA line
from “high” to “low” when SCL line is “high”. Data flow or address is transmitted after the Start
condition.

All slave devices connected to I^2 C bus should detect the 8-bit address issued after Start condition and
send the correct ACK. After receiving matching address, GT911 acknowledges by configuring SDA
line as output port and pulling SDA line low during the ninth SCL cycle. When receiving unmatched
address, namely, not 0XBA or 0XBB, GT911 will stay in an idle state.

For data bytes on SDA, each of 9 serial bits will be sent on nine SCL cycles. Each data byte consists
of 8 valid data bits and one ACK or NACK bit sent by the recipient. The data transmission is valid
when SCL line is “high”.

When communication is completed, the host will issue the STOP condition. Stop condition implies the
transition of SDA line from “low” to “high” when SCL line is “high”.

#### b) Writing Data to GT911...............................................................................................................

```
(For example：device address is 0xBA/0xBB)
```
```
Timing for Write Operation
```
The diagram above displays the timing sequence of the host writing data onto GT911. First, the host
issues a Start condition. Then, the host sends 0XBA (address bits and R/W bit; R/W bit as 0 indicates
Write operation) to the slave device.

After receiving ACK, the host sends the 16-bit register address (where writing starts) and the 8-bit
data bytes (to be written onto the register).

The location of the register address pointer will automatically add 1 after every Write Operation.
Therefore, when the host needs to perform Write Operations on a group of registers of continuous
addresses, it is able to write continuously. The Write Operation is terminated when the host issues the
Stop condition.

```
#### c) Reading Data from GT911.......................................................................................................

(For example：device address is 0xBA/0xBB)

```
Timing for Read Operation
```
The diagram above is the timing sequence of the host reading data from GT911. First, the host issues
a Start condition and sends 0XBA (address bits and R/W bit; R/W bit as 0 indicates Write operation)
to the slave device.

After receiving ACK, the host sends the 16-bit register address (where reading starts) to the slave
device. Then the host sets register addresses which need to be read.

Also after receiving ACK, the host issues the Start condition once again and sends 0XBB (Read
Operation). After receiving ACK, the host starts to read data.

GT911 also supports continuous Read Operation and, by default, reads data continuously. Whenever
receiving a byte of data, the host sends an ACK signal indicating successful reception. After receiving
the last byte of data, the host sends a NACK signal followed by a STOP condition which terminates
communication.

## 7. HotKnot Mode.............................................................................................................................................

## 7.1 Start HotKnot......................................................................................................................................

When data needs to be sent, the host sends command 0x21 to GT9, enabling GT911 to enter
" Approach mode" and work as a transmitting terminal. GT911 will then be able to detect the
receiving terminal communicating with it. When GT911 succeeds in detecting the receiving terminal, it
will notify the the host to shut off LCD using an interrupt signal and then transmit data to the
receiveing terminal.

## 7.2 Data Transmission between TPs.....................................................................................................

After GT911 and another Hotknot terminal successfully detect one another, the host downloads
HotKnot transmission firmware and sends the firmware to both terminals. While the transmission
firmware runs, the two terminals are ready for data transmission, entering Receive mode by default.
When the GT911 Transmit Buffer is refreshed correctly, GT911 works as the transmitting terminal and
immediately transmits data to the other HotKnot terminal, which works as a receiving terminal
detecting data sent by GT911.

## 7.3 Host Receives Data from GT911.....................................................................................................

Following recieval or transmission of a data frame, GT911 inverts INT to notify the host to process
data.

After receiving a data frame, the the host reads the value of the HotKnot-featured status register. If
the value of the receive-status register indicates a successful reception, the host will read the data
from the Receive Buffer via I^2 C. After reading the recieved data, the host writes 0xAA to the
designated address and notifies GT911 that data reading is complete.

After GT911 transmits a data frame, the host reads the value of the HotKnot-featured status register.
If the value of the transmit-status register indicates a successful transmission, the host will read the
data from the Transmit Buffer via I^2 C. After reading this data, the host writes 0xAA to the designated
address and notifies GT911 that data reading is complete. GT911 will automatically switch to Receive
mode and will not start transmitting until Transmit Buffer is refreshed again.

## 8. Description on Functions..........................................................................................................................

### 8.1 Operating Modes............................................................................................................................

#### a) Normal Mode..............................................................................................................................

When GT911 is operating in Normal mode, its minimum coordinate refresh cycle is 7ms-10ms
(subject to configuration; one step is 1ms).

When no touch occurs for a certain period (0s to 15s, subject to configuration; one step is 1s) in
Normal mode, GT911 will automatically switch to Green mode to reduce power consumption.


```
GOODIXCONFIDENTIAL
Reproduction and/or distribution of this document in whole or in
part is strictly prohibited without written consent of GOODIX.
```
#### b) Green Mode................................................................................................................................

In Green mode, the scanning cycle for GT911 is about 40ms. It automatically enters Normal mode if
any touch is detected.

#### c) Gesture Mode.............................................................................................................................

After the host enables GT911 to enter Gesture mode by sending I2C command 8 to 0x8046 and then
to 0x8040, wake-up can be achieved by swipe, double-tap, or writing of specified letters on TP.

In Gesture mode, when GT911 detects any finger swipe on TP for a sufficiently long distance, INT will
output a pulse for longer than 250us or a high level causing the host to wake up and turn on the
screen.

In Gesture mode, when GT911 detects any double-tap on TP, INT will output a pulse for longer than
250us or a high level causing the host to wake up and turn on the screen.

In Gesture mode, when GT911 detects any writing of specified letters on the TP, INT will output a
pulse for longer than 250us or a high level causing the host to wake up and turn on the screen.

**d) Sleep Mode**

GT911 enters Sleep mode if it receives corresponding I^2 C command from the host (requires INT
output low before the command). GT911 exits Sleep mode and enters Normal mode when host
outputs a high level to INT pin for 2ms to 5ms. The interval between sending screen-off command
and wake-up should be longer than 58ms.

#### e) Approach Mode..........................................................................................................................

When HotKnot proximity detection is enabled, GT911 operates in Approach mode by default. If
GT911 exits Approach mode, the host can enable it to enter Approach mode again by sending
command 0x20 or 0x21. In Approach mode, touch detection and near-field proximity detection
alternate.


```
GOODIXCONFIDENTIAL

part is strictly prohibited without written consent of GOODIX.
```
If the host sends 0x21 to GT911, GT911 will work as a transmitting terminal and transmit signals with
a specified pattern and frequency via Tx and Rx channels. Then, GT911 detects whether there are
feedback signals with the same specified pattern and frequency from the receiving terminal. This
helps to determine whether any receiving terminal exists. If the host sends 0x20 to GT9, GT911 will
work as a Receiving terminal and detect signals with a specified pattern and frequency from the
transmitting terminal. If such a signal is detected, GT911 responds using signals with the specified
pattern and frequency to the transmitting terminal.

In Approach mode, when detecting any HotKnot-compatible terminal within the near-field range,
GT911 will notify the host via INT to capture status. To ensure reliable detection between the
transmitting terminal and the receiving terminal, it is required to keep detecting for a minimum of
150ms after the two terminals have detected each other. Then the host downloads and sends
HotKnot transmission firmware to enable GT911 to enter Receive mode.

#### f) Receive Mode.............................................................................................................................

In Approach mode, after notified that GT911 has successfully detected another HotKnot terminal, the
host downloads and sends HotKnot transmission firmware to enable GT911 to enter Receive mode.
In Receive mode, GT911 continues to detect frame start signal, once the signal is detected, GT
begins to detect and receive data. When the receiving process is completed, GT911 verifies the data.
If GT911 finds erroneous data, the receiving process begins again. If the data is found to be correct,
GT911 notifies the host via INT to read data in the Receive Buffer.

#### g) Send Mode..................................................................................................................................

When GT911 works in Receive mode, the host sends outgoing data to the Transmit Buffer. When
detecting that the Transmit Buffer is refreshed and there is data to be sent, GT911 automatically
switches from Receive mode to Send mode. In Send mode, GT911 sends a frame start signal. If it
detects ACK fed back from the receiving terminal, it continues to send the data signal. After sending a
data chunk, GT911 begins to detect ACK. If it does not detect any ACK or if it detects an erroneous
ACK, GT911 will resend the data chunk. If this resending fails over 5 times, it will resend the current
data frame another time to the receiving terminal until the host enables GT911 to exit Send mode due
to timeout. If GT911 detects ACK and sends the data successfully, it will automatically switch to
Receive mode after the host completes the data processing or due to timeout.

### 8.2 Interrupt Triggering Mechanism...................................................................................................

When touched, GT911 sends a pulse via INT pin in every scanning cycle to notify the host to read
coordinates. Host will then set a triggering mechanism via relevant register “INT” bit. INT as “0” indicates
rising edge-triggered, which means GT911 will notify the host by driving INT output from low to high when
operated by user; INT as “1” indicates falling edge-triggered, which means GT911 will notify the host by
pulling INT output from high to low when operated by user.


```

```
### 8.3 Sleep Mode.....................................................................................................................................

When the touch screen is off or there are no running operations on the TP, the host sends I^2 C
command to enable GT911 to enter Sleep mode, which reduces power consumption. When GT
needs to operate, the host outputs a high level to INT pin for a certain period to awake it. For detailed
timings of host enabling GT911 to enter and exit Sleep mode, please refer to section 8.1.

### 8.4 Stationary Configuration...............................................................................................................

GT911 supports Stationary Configuration. After receiving configuration parameters from the host,
GT911 will fix parameters to the latest version. Once these parameters are fixed, GT911 will
communicate with the host solely via I2C bus and will not receive any parameters of previous
versions from the host.

### 8.5 Adaptive Frequency Hopping......................................................................................................

GT911 is equipped with reliable anti-interference hardware. When the drive spectrum of GT
overlaps with the peak spectrum of noise signal, GT911 will switch to another frequency using a
self-adaptive frequency hopping mechanism to avoid interference.

### 8.6 Self-calibration................................................................................................................................

#### a) Self-calibration during Initialization.........................................................................................

Fluctuations in temperature, humidity and environment may affect the reference capacitance of the
capacitive sensor in idle state. GT911 will update detection reference capacitance according to
environmental conditions within the first 200ms of initialization. Then, GT911 will complete the
initialization of the TP test.

#### b) Automatic Drift Compensation.................................................................................................

Gradual changes in environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, or dust may also affect the
reference capacitance of the capacitive sensor in idle state. GT911 will detect real-time changes in
data and perform statistic analysis of historic data to revise reference capacitance and thus reduce
the impact that environmental changes have on the TP test.
